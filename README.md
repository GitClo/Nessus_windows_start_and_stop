# Nessus_windows_start_and_stop
Bat files to enable you to start and stop Tenable Nessus service quickly on windows.

Hey there! I'm a user of the popular security scanner nessus on windows. However, I've found out it has NO start/stop options. It starts automatically every time you reboot, taking those precious resources, so I've decided to make 2 .bat scripts to start / stop the "Tenable Nessus" service. 

Tutorial: go to services and locate "Tenable Nessus" open it's properties and change startup to "manual", now it won't start on startup. Download my .bat files and you are good to go! (Don't forget to run them as admin)
